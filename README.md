## My process

After I watched a YouTube video for the last challenge I tried to use the same workflow on this challenge, 
but this time completely on my own.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to use the Grid System and how to make the first div double the size than the rest of them.
